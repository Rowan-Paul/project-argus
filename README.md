# project-argus

Project Argus tracks everything for you; movies, tv shows, music and games. All in a modern looking web application, all open source.

## Technologies

The app will make use of the following technologies:

- React
- Redux
- Node
- MongoDB
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router

As the project progresses, there will be more technologies added as necessary.

## Different apps

There are several different parts of Project Argus that track different stuff:

- Andromeda: this will be the front page that connects all the different apps with each other
- Cepheus: this will track tv and movies
- Delphinus: this will track games
- Lyra: this will track music
- Orion: the backend server and database

Each app will be seperated as to be able to have them work completly independent from each other.
